        <h2>What is period poverty?</h2>
        <p>Period poverty is the inacessiblity and unaffordability of period products. This is caused by heavy taxes on sanitary products and general stigma about the subject. As a result, there is a large lack of knowledge on the subject, which can prevent people from maintaining proper mentrual health during their period. A lack of other sanitary essentials, like toilets, can perpetuate the problem.

        <h2>How can period poverty impact people?</h2>
        <p>Millions of people can't afford period products or can't find access to clean water for their menstrual hygiene, which negatively impacts their health. Lack of access to safe toilets means that many girls are unable to go to school.
            The stigma around periods makes it harder for women. According the UNWomen, "In Bangladesh and Egypt, only 32 per cent and 66 per cent of girls, respectively, said they were aware of menstruation before they got their first period, many were shocked and afraid."
            Without proper information about their period, women can't maintain proper menstrual health. Also, this stigma also means that decision makers don't have enough information to make safe decisions for women. </p>

        <h2>How to Help</h2> centre aligned
        <h4>Product Drives</h4>     make sure h4 isn't as small as p
        <p>In a product drive, people can donate period products to an organization. For those who struggle to afford menstrual products, product drives can offer them great support. For example, <a href = https://uwbc.ca/program/period-promise/>United Way BC</a> collects and distributes menstrual products. It also accepts donations! You can also host your own product drive by working with your local community.<p>
      
        <h4>Donating to Charities</h4>
        <p>By choosing to donate to charities, you enable them to buy more resources to distribute to women and girls, and also give them the means to spread more awareness about periods. At <a href = "https://allianceforperiodsupplies.org/take-action/">Alliance for Period Supplies</a>, purchasing certain products leads to a donation to them!</p>

        <h4>Spreading Awareneess</h4>
        <p>Spreading awareness goes a long way in breaking the stigma behind periods. You can do this by making social media posts, which can reach a wide audience of people. Sending others websites, such as <a href="https://letstalkperiod.ca/">Let's Talk Period</a> or <a href="https://period.org/advocacy">Period USA</a>, which lists out harmful bills and helpful bills to mentruation. It also links to contact your local goverment representative to overturn or promote these policies. Lastly, even just talking about period poverty can help make a change!</p>
